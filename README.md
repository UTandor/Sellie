## Project Overview
Sellie, is made with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS which is bundled with Vite. Its core functionalities include authentication, a dynamic dashboard, real-time client chat functionality, an AI chatbot (which is going to use GPT-3.5 in the future), and a tabular representation of a client's leads.

## Getting Started

#### Initiate the  with the following steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UTandor/Sellie.git
cd Sellie
npm install
npm run dev
```
Access the application via http://localhost:5173 in your preferred browser.

## Key Features

### Authentication
Sellie offers dual authentication methods - the conventional username-password combo and Google OAuth for a seamless and secure login experience.

### Dashboard
Upon successful login, users are welcomed by a responsive dashboard, providing an intuitive interface for lead tracking and management. The dashboard's layout is to be decided by the lead designer.

### Client Chat
Real-time client communication is facilitated through a fast and reliable chat interface. The chat page is going to be a customizable interface to avoid it being clunky for mobile users and easier to navigate for desktop users.

### AI Chatbot
Sellie's AI chatbot uses GPT-3.5 API to respond to user queries. It is going to process PDFs, contextual text, and text from images. The chatbot provides a versatile solution for client interactions. The chatbot is going to be free and will require no cost to run as we will be using a free chatbot API which can be seen <a href="https://rapidapi.com/acolydebaian8/api/gpts4u/">here</a>.

### Leads Table
The lead table offers a view of leads in a tabular format. The table will also be customizable showing data regarding the user's leads like their phone name, number, status and more.


## Next Steps:
1. Building the site's Login and Signup page.
2. Adding a foundation for later functionality of the website
3. Setting routes that are going to be used in the website.
4. Building the rest of the pages as per the UI designer's designs.
